# TRMNL Images

A repository of images optimized for use on [TRMNL](https://trmnl.com/) devices. Effort has been taken to capture the fidelity of the original logos while rendered in 2 or 4 color grayscale, but some small changes have been made to ensure best results on as wide a range of screens as possible.

## Usage
To reference the images hosted here on GitHub directly, use the format `{{base_url}}/{{league}}/{{style}}/{{team_id}}.svg`
* `style` is either "color", "2-bit" or "1-bit"
* `team_id`s are not official, but generally conform to the most common 2 or 3 letter code used by the leagues and various sports broadcasters
* `base_url` for all sports logos is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/playingdicewiththeuniverse/trmnl-images/refs/heads/main/sports`

## Hockey - NHL
